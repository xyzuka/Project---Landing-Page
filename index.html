        <p class="quote-text">"I have been a member with Evolution Fitness for over 2 years now and could not recommend this place enough. The community they have built and the group programming is second to none! I have also been lucky enough to work one-on-one with John during this time and he has had such a positive impact on my life, inside and outside of the gym. He is extremely knowledgeable on all things training but he is also very generous in sharing as much of that knowledge as he can to make sure I get the most out of our time together."</p>
